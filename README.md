# LocoIO-Editor

LocoIO-Editor is a device to monitor settings within LocoIOs on a modelrailroad-layout without PC or commandstation.<br>
In LocoIO.ino you can select whether the software should be compiled for the usage with LCD or OLED.<br>
Note: When using the LCD, there are restrictions in the range of functions<br>
For more details please refer to the [manual](Documentation/LocoIO-Editor-Bedienungsanleitung.pdf)<br>
